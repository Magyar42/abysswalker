ABYSSWALKER Guide

= OVERVIEW =
- A text-based game following the design and gameplay of “He is Coming”, a simplistic roguelite RPG, based on the lore, story and world of Dark Souls.
- The gameplay loop consists of spending several days and nights in a randomly generated world, where you can find enemies to fight and items/special events to encounter. You grow stronger in preparation for a boss fight after the days have passed.

= GAMEPLAY =
- Before starting, the play can choose from a few items to take with them as they begin.
- The player can move across accessible tiles with the WASD keys. To interact with objects and enemies, the player must occupy the same tile as them. Each move will pass the time slightly until it has reached nighttime.
- This repeats for 3 days and 3 nights, after which a boss will engage the player. The player knows which boss will appear ahead of time, and can view their stats and any unique mechanics at any time before and during the fight.
- If successful, this loop repeats with a new boss. After each boss, the player will unlock additional item slots. Defeating the final boss will grant victory.
- During battle, you will take turns attacking one another. Your items can activate and help you in combat, but the enemy may have an ability too.
- Several special locations can be interacted with, which can improve your stats, provide new items, and more.
