= OVERVIEW = 
- A text-based game following the design and gameplay of “He is Coming”, a simplistic roguelite RPG, based on the lore, story and world of Dark Souls.
- The gameplay loop consists of spending several days and nights in a randomly generated world, where you can find enemies to fight and items/special events to encounter. You grow stronger in preparation for a boss fight after the days have passed.
- Each boss defeated will provide more item slots for you, and will allow you to progress until the final boss of the area. Defeating it will result in victory.
- Not all items are immediately available; some have certain conditions that must be met during any game, at which point they will be unlocked for all future games.

= STARTING A GAME =
- When starting a new game, the player must choose which area to play in. Each area will have different enemies, items, bosses and mechanics. Initially, there is only one area available: Undead Settlement.
- In addition, the player must choose a starting archetype, though only the Knight is available at first. Each class has different stats allocated to health, shield, speed and attack, and starts with different items.
- Lastly, the player can optionally choose from various artefacts to start with. Initially, only 3 are available: Life Ring, Fire Gem, Black Firebombs.

= GAMEPLAY =
- The player can move across accessible tiles with the arrow keys. To interact with objects and enemies, the player must occupy the same tile as them. Each move will pass the time slightly until it has reached nighttime.
- During night, the radius of the visible map is greatly reduced, with objects and enemies at a distance showing up as “?”. After enough steps have been taken, the next day begins.
- This repeats for 3 days and 3 nights, after which a boss will engage the player. The player knows which boss will appear ahead of time, and can view their stats and any unique mechanics at any time before and during the fight.
- If successful, this loop repeats with a new boss. After each boss, the player will unlock additional item slots.
- The final boss of the area is not randomised, and will act as the 3rd boss. This final boss will have a very unique or challenging mechanic that must be prepared for. Defeating this boss will grant victory.
- If the player loses any battle at any time, they lose. However, they might have unlocked new items that can be found in-game, as well as made progress towards unlocking other archetypes and starting artefacts.
